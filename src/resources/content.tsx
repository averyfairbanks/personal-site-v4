      `Designed and developed a new SMS-distributed digital wallet loyalty product - creating a new revenue stream \
        per client of $3k+ a month, in addition to the engineering hours charged, which continues to attract new brands.`,

        70% of billed third party vendor calls, allowing us to pass on that savings to one of our biggest clients.`,
      `Proposed new team-wide interface-driven design patterns that have since been adopted across the majority of \
        Tactical-owned services, standardizing large portions of the code and simplifying collaboration.`,
      `Adapted company standard cursor-based pagination pattern to support sorting based on multiple fields, including \
        arbitrary fields like strings, delivering functionality requested by clients and enabling native compatibility with \
        graph-connected UI components provided by our platform team.`,
      `Coordinated between our team and several other engineering teams to add additional functionality to their \
        domain-specific services to unblock a project automating the onboarding of over 10,000 new billable company accounts.`,
